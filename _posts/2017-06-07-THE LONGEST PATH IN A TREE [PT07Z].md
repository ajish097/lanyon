Click [here](http://www.spoj.com/problems/PT07Z/) or on the post title to read the question.

The given problem is to find longest path in a given tree (a.k.a diameter of a tree).
We can solve this problem by applying bfs, twice to the given graph. Now you may be wondering how?

Here is a great answer written by [Snehangshu Chakraborty](https://www.quora.com/How-does-following-algorithm-for-finding-longest-path-in-tree-work/answer/Snehangshu-Chakraborty) and a much more technical proof by [Raziman T.V.](https://www.quora.com/How-does-following-algorithm-for-finding-longest-path-in-tree-work/answer/Raziman-T-V?srid=t2IF) that you can go through.

So, let me just walk you through my code.
